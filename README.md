This is just the Chinese translation of the prompt message in the quality-armory plugin, which is enough to cover about 80% of the content text.
After loading the plugin, put the file in the "lang" folder and change the language in config to "cn".

If I have time, I will make Japanese and Traditional Chinese translations, you can also refer to the Simplified Chinese version and edit the yml file directly to change it to the language you need. This may be much more convenient for some non-English native speakers.
Quality-Armory is the best armory content I have ever played in Minecraft. So all of this is free.



这只是quality-armory插件中提示消息的中文翻译，这足以涵盖约80%的内容文本。
在加载插件后将此文件放入“lang”文件夹并在config中的语言"lang"选项改为“cn”即可。
插件具体内容参见https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/quality-armory.47561/reviews

如果我有时间，我将会制作日语和繁体中文的翻译，您也可以参照简体中文版本直接编辑yml文件，将它改为你需要的语言。这也许会对一些非英语母语的人方便得多。
Quality-Armory是我在Minecraft玩过最棒的军械内容。所以这一切全都是无偿的。
